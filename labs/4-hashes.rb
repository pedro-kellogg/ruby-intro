# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 4-hashes.rb

# EXERCISE
# Ask the user for the current amount of Bitcoin that they own.
# Using the Ruby hash `bitcoin_data`, display a summary of
# Bitcoin data for the user. Something similar to the sample
# output in step 4 below.

# 1. Get input from a user using gets.chomp
puts "How much bitcoin do you have? (enter any numerical value)"
bitcoin = gets.chomp

# 2. The value will be a string, so you'll want to convert it to a Float
bitcoin = bitcoin.to_f #to_f will convert the string to float

# 3. Inspect the bitcoin_data hash
# puts bitcoin_data["USD"]["last"]

# 4. Display the value of the user's bitcoin
# Sample output:
last_valueUSD = bitcoin_data["USD"]["last"]
invested = last_valueUSD*bitcoin
puts "1 Bitcoin is valued at $#{last_valueUSD} USD."
puts "Your Bitcoin is worth $#{invested.round(2)}."
